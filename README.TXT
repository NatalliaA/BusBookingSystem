TECHNOLOGY: Java, BlueJ
DATE: 2013
AUTHOR: Natallia Akulenka

DESCRIPTION of the PROJECT:

A coach company owns a number of coaches which are used for day trips to a variety of destinations.  
These trips are advertised and customers respond by booking seats on a coach.  
The trips appeal largely to elderly people but some outings attract children accompanied by an adult. 
Children are charged half the adult price. 
Each trip has associated with it a list of bookings which have been made on it.  
A booking includes, for example, the name and phone number of the booking customer 
together with the number of adults and the number of children in the party.
The final system will use a database to store such details, and will have a sophisticated user interface.
For this work you will build a prototype in BlueJ with test drivers to simulate the booking of seats.  
These drivers will need to output the state of the objects that you create to the Terminal Window.
to demonstrate that your solution works.
